# The best Hardhat Typescript Template

This is a template to do EVM smart contract development with all my favorite toolings and no fluff:

## Typescript

Goes without saying, will make your developer experience so, so much better than vanilla JS

## Typechain

Generates typings for your contracts after compiling automatically (in `./typechain`)

## Hardhat-deploy

Allows for more modular deployments. See [their docs](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) for more on how to unleash its power

## Mocha, chai, chai-ethers, chai-as-promised

Allows for easy testing with improved compatability with asynchronous functions and smart contracts (reverts, BigNumber, etc.)

## Hadhat-contract-sizer

Size matters on the blockchain. See [their docs](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/hardhat-contract-sizer) for configuration details, but you can simply run `yarn size` and you'll get a breakdown of how big each contract is.

## Prettier

Configured for both your Solidity and Typescript code

## .env parsing

In `./utils/config.ts` you can configure your environment variables to have default values so things don't break midway through your script because you forgot an environment variable.
